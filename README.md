Approach Document for Call Center Data Analysis
Project Title: Call Center Data Analysis
Introduction
The objective of this project is to analyze call center data to generate actionable insights aimed at improving customer experience and operational efficiency. This document outlines the methodology, parameters, and steps involved in the analysis.

Parameters Considered for Insights
Customer NPS (Net Promoter Score)

Purpose: Measure customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Insights: Identify factors contributing to high or low satisfaction levels.
Call Duration

Purpose: Assess operational efficiency and identify potential bottlenecks.
Insights: Determine if longer calls correlate with specific issues or lower satisfaction.
Transcript Sentiment

Purpose: Analyze customer emotions and feedback.
Insights: Identify common themes in positive or negative interactions.
Date

Purpose: Enable time-based analysis to identify trends and seasonality.
Insights: Track changes in performance and satisfaction over time.
Reponse Team Location

Purpose: Evaluate performance across different teams or locations.
Insights: Identify best practices and areas needing improvement.
Broker Company Details

Purpose: Understand the impact of different brokers on customer interactions.
Insights: Identify brokers associated with higher satisfaction or efficiency.
Methodology
Data Cleaning and Preparation

Handle missing values and convert data types as necessary.
Ensure data consistency and accuracy for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize distributions and relationships between key parameters.
Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data.
Sentiment Analysis

Use TextBlob to classify transcript sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.
Analyze sentiment distribution and its correlation with other parameters.
Correlation Analysis

Examine relationships between call duration, NPS, and sentiment.
Identify factors that significantly impact customer satisfaction.
Time Series Analysis

Analyze trends over time to identify seasonal patterns or changes in performance.
Segment Analysis

Break down data by response team location and broker company to identify specific insights.
Machine Learning Component
Objective

Predict customer churn based on sentiment analysis and other features.
Features Used

Sentiment Score, Call Duration, Reponse Team Location
Model Training

Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
Data Split: 80% training and 20% testing
Code Implementation

Python

Collapse
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from textblob import TextBlob

# Sentiment Analysis Function
def get_sentiment(text):
    analysis = TextBlob(text)
    return analysis.sentiment.polarity

# Add Sentiment Score and Churn Labels
data['Sentiment Score'] = data['Transcript'].apply(get_sentiment)
data['Churn'] = data['Customer NPS'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x <= 6 else 0)

# Prepare Features and Labels
features = ['Sentiment Score', 'Call Duration', 'Reponse Team Location']
X = pd.get_dummies(data[features], drop_first=True)
y = data['Churn']

# Train-Test Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the Random Forest Classifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the Model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Feature Importance
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
feature_importance = pd.Series(model.feature_importances_, index=X.columns).sort_values(ascending=False)
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
feature_importance.plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue')
plt.title('Feature Importance for Churn Prediction')
plt.show()
Evaluation

Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Feature Importance
Insights: Identify key predictors of customer churn
Tools and Technologies
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TextBlob, Scikit-learn
Version Control: GitHub for code management
Conclusion
This approach document outlines the key parameters and methodology for analyzing call center data. By focusing on these areas, we aim to generate actionable insights that enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
